# About

What and who is this?
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The initial setup of this site has been completed by Dave from [Libraries Hacked](https://blog.librarydata.uk). You can [contact me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/librarieshacked), or you can [send me an email](mailto:info@librarieshacked.org)

All contributors and suggestions for change are very welcome. This site is [developed openly on GitHub](https://github.com/LibrariesHacked/librarylab). Each page has an 'Edit this page on GitHub' link for seeing the page code. If you would like to suggest changes, and are familiar with GitHub, you are welcome to do it through [raising an issue in GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). If not familiar with that process, please feel free to get in touch by Twitter or email.
