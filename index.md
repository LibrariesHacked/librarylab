# Public library lab
{: .fs-9 }

A space to prototype digital applications to aid the public in using and exploring their libraries
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

There are few opportunities in public libraries to experiment with online applications. A lack of time, investment, and skills make this difficult.

But lots of people have ideas and are willing to try things out. A prototype is a draft. It explores how something could work. How it might look, the user experience, and the functionality.

The idea of this space is to build a community around library prototypes.

* List ideas that could be developed and openly shared
* Find people that can fill the skills gap in making ideas come alive
* Collaborate on work to develop prototypes into demonstrable applications

## Principles

1. To prioritise accessibility, ethics, and privacy in creating tools
2. Ensure everyone with ideas and an interest can contribute, with no barrier to participation
3. Involve people from all areas of interest of public libraries including staff and the public
4. Ensuring that any data used is freely available for all as [open data](https://theodi.org/article/what-is-open-data-and-why-should-we-care/)
5. To develop prototypes following standards of [coding in the open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/)
