# Public library lab
{: .fs-9 }

A space to prototype applications and tools to aid the public in using and exploring their libraries
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

There are few opportunities in public libraries to experiment with online applications. A lack of time, funding, investment, and skills make this difficult.

But lots of people have ideas of things that could be done, and they could be involved in. A prototype is a draft. It explores how something could work. How it might look, the user experience, and the functionality.

The idea of this space is to build a community around library prototypes.

* List ideas that could be built on and openly shared
* Find people that can fill the skills gap in making ideas come alive
* Joint work to develop prototypes into demonstrable applications

## Principles

* Ensure everyone with ideas and an interest can contribute with no barrier to entry
* Involve people from all areas of interest of public libraries including staff and the public
* To use and promote [open data](https://theodi.org/article/what-is-open-data-and-why-should-we-care/). Ensuring that any data used is freely available for all
* To develop and work on prototypes [in the open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/)
* To pay attention to accessibility, ethics, and privacy in creating tools
