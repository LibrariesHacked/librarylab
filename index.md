# Library lab
{: .fs-9 }

A space to prototype applications that aid the public in using their libraries
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

There are few opportunities in public libraries to experiment with online applications. A lack of time, investment, and skills make this difficult. But many people have ideas and are want to try things out. A prototype is a draft. It explores how something could work, how it might look, the user experience, and the functionality.

This space is to build a community around library prototypes.

* List ideas that could be developed and shared
* Find people that can fill the skills gap in making ideas happen
* Collaborate on work to develop prototypes into demonstrable applications

## Principles

1. Prioritise [digital accessibility](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction), ethics, and privacy
2. Ensure everyone with ideas and an interest can contribute, with no barrier to participation
3. Involve people from all areas of interest of public libraries, including front-line staff and the public
4. Ensuring any data used is freely available for all as [open data](https://theodi.org/article/what-is-open-data-and-why-should-we-care/)
5. Develop prototypes following standards of [coding in the open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/)
