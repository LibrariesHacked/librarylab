# Public library lab
{: .fs-9 }

A space to prototype applications and tools to aid the public in using and exploring their libraries
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

There are few opportunities in public libraries to experiment with online applications. A lack of time, funding, investment, and skills make this difficult.

But lots of people have ideas of things that could be done and they could be involved in. A prototype is a draft. It provides an opportunity to explore how something could work. How it might look, the user experience, and the functionality.

The idea of this space is to build a community around library prototypes.

* Submit ideas that could be built on and openly shared
* Find people that can fill the skills gap in making your idea come alive
* Joint work on 

## Principles

Proposed principles of library lab are:

* To ensure everyone with ideas and an interest can contribute, with no barriers to entry
* To involve people from all areas of interest in libraries: staff and the public
* To use and promote open data. Ensuring that any data used is freely avaialble to all for any purpose
