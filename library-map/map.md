# Map of libraries

View libraries across the UK in an interactive map
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The map page displays libraries and mobile library stops but also adds other geographic features such as:

* Displaying library service boundary lines
* Displaying mobile library route lines
* Determining travel durations at different intervals to libraries and mobile library stops
